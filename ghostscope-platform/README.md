# ghostscope-platform

`ghostscope-platform` abstracts kernel, architecture, and BTF quirks so the rest of GhostScope can reason about processes in a portable way. It normalizes kernel symbols, exposes helper traits, and provides struct definitions shared with the protocol crate.

Refer to the workspace documentation for background and integration details: <https://github.com/swananan/ghostscope#readme>.
