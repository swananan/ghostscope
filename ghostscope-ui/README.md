# ghostscope-ui

`ghostscope-ui` is the async TUI for GhostScope. It renders live trace output, handles keyboard interaction, and summaries of variables/structures streamed over the GhostScope protocol.

It builds on `ratatui`, `tokio`, and `crossterm`. For screenshots and walkthroughs, visit <https://github.com/swananan/ghostscope#readme>.
