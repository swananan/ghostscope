# dwarf-tool

`dwarf-tool` is a standalone binary that ships with GhostScope for inspecting DWARF information and validating the `ghostscope-dwarf` parser stack. It is useful when debugging symbol resolution without running the full tracing pipeline.

Usage examples and context can be found in the main documentation: <https://github.com/swananan/ghostscope#readme>.
